Since the current flowing through the $12\Omega$ resistor is $1A$ we must have the equivalent resistance viewed from the voltage source is $20\Omega$. Therefore we must have 
$$\frac{10R}{10+R}=8$$
$$10R=80+8R$$
$$2R=80$$
$$R=\boxed{40\Omega}$$

And the voltage drop across $R$ is
$$20\frac{8}{20}=\boxed{8V}$$
