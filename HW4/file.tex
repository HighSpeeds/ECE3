For the open circuit, let the voltage at the node be $V$, we have

$$V=\frac{3I_x-V}{2}+I_x$$
and
$$I_x=\frac{10-V}{5}$$

Solving these we get $I_x=1.5A$, therefore we would have that $V_{th}=10-3I_x=\boxed{5.5V}$

Now we attach a resistor with resistance $R$ across the nodes, then we would still 
have

$$V=\frac{3I_x-V}{2}+I_x$$
and
$$I_x=\frac{10-V}{5}$$

and thus we would have $I_x=1.5A$

therefore the current flowing across the reistor is 
$I_R=\frac{10-3Ix}{R}$

Therefore we have
$$I_{sc}=\lim_{R\to0}I_R=\infty$$

Therefore we have

$$R_{eq}=\frac{V_{th}}{I_{sc}}=\boxed{0}$$
