\maketitle
We have that $$I_{body}=\frac{120.001}{400M+200k}=299.852nA$$
Therefore we must have $$V_{s^{-}}=59.970V$$
and 
$$V_{s^{+}}=60.031V$$
From virtual short principle we must have $V_{s^{-}}=V_2$ and $V_{s^{+}}=V_1$, therefore from the voltage divider princple we must have that $v_n=v_p=54.518V$ for the
right most op amp. 
Therefore we must have that the current flowing across the upper 10k ohm resistor is $${V_{s^{+}}-v_p}{10k}=0.551A$$
Therefore we must have that that $$V_{o}=\boxed{-609mV}$$
