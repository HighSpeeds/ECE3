\maketitle
Because these op amps are Ideal we have that the negative node voltages are both $0$ therefore we have, the current output from the 5V source is $5mA$, therfore the
voltage drop across the 2k Ohm resistor is $10V$, therefore the current across the 3k Ohm resistor is $3.3333mA$, therefore voltage across the 4K ohm resistor and $V_{out}$ is
$\boxed{13.3333V}$
